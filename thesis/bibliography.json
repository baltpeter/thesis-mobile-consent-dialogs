  {"id":"degelingWeValueYour2019","abstract":"The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect on May 25, 2018. Its privacy regulations apply to any service and company collecting or processing personal data in Europe. Many companies had to adjust their data handling processes, consent forms, and privacy policies to comply with the GDPR’s transparency requirements. We monitored this rare event by analyzing changes on popular websites in all 28 member states of the European Union. For each country, we periodically examined its 500 most popular websites – 6,579 in total – for the presence of and updates to their privacy policy between December 2017 and October 2018. While many websites already had privacy policies, we ﬁnd that in some countries up to 15.7 % of websites added new privacy policies by May 25, 2018, resulting in 84.5 % of websites having privacy policies. 72.6 % of websites with existing privacy policies updated them close to the date. After May this positive development slowed down noticeably. Most visibly, 62.1 % of websites in Europe now display cookie consent notices, 16 % more than in January 2018. These notices inform users about a site’s cookie use and user tracking practices. We categorized all observed cookie consent notices and evaluated 28 common implementations with respect to their technical realization of cookie consent. Our analysis shows that core web security mechanisms such as the same-origin policy pose problems for the implementation of consent according to GDPR rules, and opting out of third-party cookies requires the third party to cooperate. Overall, we conclude that the web became more transparent at the time GDPR came into force, but there is still a lack of both functional and usable mechanisms for users to consent to or deny processing of their personal data on the Internet.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Degeling","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Utz","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Lentzsch","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Hosseini","given":"Henry"},{"family":"Schaub","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Holz","given":"Thorsten"}],"citation-key":"degelingWeValueYour2019","container-title":"Proceedings 2019 Network and Distributed System Security Symposium","DOI":"10.14722/ndss.2019.23378","event":"Network and Distributed System Security Symposium","event-place":"San Diego, CA","ISBN":"978-1-891562-55-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Internet Society","publisher-place":"San Diego, CA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"We Value Your Privacy ...

We empirically study  this  question  by  detecting  and  analyzing  cookie  notices in  an  automated  way.  We  crawl  1,500  European,  American,and  Canadian  websites  from  each  of  18  countries.  We  detect cookie  notices  on  40%  of  websites  in  our  sample.  We  treat  the presence or absence of cookie notices, as well as visual differences,as  proxies  for  differences  in  privacy  rules.  Using  a  series  of regression models, we find that the website’s Top Level Domain explains  a  substantial  portion  of  the  variance  in  cookie  notice metrics, but the users vantage point does not. This suggests that websites follow one set of privacy rules for all their users.

  {"id":"hilsPrivacyPreferenceSignals2021","abstract":"Abstract\nPrivacy preference signals are digital representations of how users want their personal data to be processed. Such signals must be adopted by both the sender (users) and intended recipients (data processors). Adoption represents a coordination problem that remains unsolved despite efforts dating back to the 1990s. Browsers implemented standards like the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) and Do Not Track (DNT), but vendors profiting from personal data faced few incentives to receive and respect the expressed wishes of data subjects. In the wake of recent privacy laws, a coalition of AdTech firms published the Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF), which defines an optin consent signal. This paper integrates post-GDPR developments into the wider history of privacy preference signals. Our main contribution is a high-frequency longitudinal study describing how TCF signal gained dominance as of February 2021. We explore which factors correlate with adoption at the website level. Both the number of third parties on a website and the presence of Google Ads are associated with higher adoption of TCF. Further, we show that vendors acted as early adopters of TCF 2.0 and provide two case-studies describing how Consent Management Providers shifted existing customers to TCF 2.0. We sketch ways forward","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Hils","given":"Maximilian"},{"family":"Woods","given":"Daniel W."},{"family":"Böhme","given":"Rainer"}],"citation-key":"hilsPrivacyPreferenceSignals2021","container-title":"Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies","DOI":"10.2478/popets-2021-0069","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"249-269","source":"sciendo.com","title":"Privacy Preference Signals: Past, Present and Future","title-short":"Privacy Preference Signals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://sciendo.com/en/article/10.2478/popets-2021-0069","volume":"2021"},
  {"id":"hosseiniUnifyingPrivacyPolicy2021","abstract":"Abstract\nPrivacy policies have become a focal point of privacy research. With their goal to reflect the privacy practices of a website, service, or app, they are often the starting point for researchers who analyze the accuracy of claimed data practices, user understanding of practices, or control mechanisms for users. Due to vast differences in structure, presentation, and content, it is often challenging to extract privacy policies from online resources like websites for analysis. In the past, researchers have relied on scrapers tailored to the specific analysis or task, which complicates comparing results across different studies.\nTo unify future research in this field, we developed a toolchain to process website privacy policies and prepare them for research purposes. The core part of this chain is a detector module for English and German, using natural language processing and machine learning to automatically determine whether given texts are privacy or cookie policies. We leverage multiple existing data sets to refine our approach, evaluate it on a recently published longitudinal corpus, and show that it contains a number of misclassified documents.

  {"id":"kollnigAreIPhonesReally2022","abstract":"Abstract\nWhile many studies have looked at privacy properties of the Android and Google Play app ecosystem, comparatively much less is known about iOS and the Apple App Store, the most widely used ecosystem in the US. At the same time, there is increasing competition around privacy between these smartphone operating system providers. In this paper, we present a study of 24k Android and iOS apps from 2020 along several dimensions relating to user privacy. We find that third-party tracking and the sharing of unique user identifiers was widespread in apps from both ecosystems, even in apps aimed at children. In the children’s category, iOS apps tended to use fewer advertising-related tracking than their Android counterparts, but could more often access children’s location. Across all studied apps, our study highlights widespread potential violations of US, EU and UK privacy law, including 1) the use of third-party tracking without user consent, 2) the lack of parental consent before sharing personally identifiable information (PII) with third-parties in children’s apps, 3) the non-data-minimising configuration of tracking libraries, 4) the sending of personal data to countries without an adequate level of data protection, and 5) the continued absence of transparency around tracking, partly due to","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Kollnig","given":"Konrad"},{"family":"Shuba","given":"Anastasia"},{"family":"Binns","given":"Reuben"},{"family":"Kleek","given":"Max Van"},{"family":"Shadbolt","given":"Nigel"}],"citation-key":"kollnigAreIPhonesReally2022","container-title":"Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies","DOI":"10.2478/popets-2022-0033","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"6-24","source":"sciendo.com","title":"Are iPhones Really Better for Privacy?

  {"id":"libertAutomatedApproachAuditing2018","abstract":"A dominant regulatory model for web privacy is \"notice and choice\". In this model, users are notified of data collection and provided with options to control it. To examine the efficacy of this approach, this study presents the first large-scale audit of disclosure of third-party data collection in website privacy policies. Data flows on one million websites are analyzed and over 200,000 websites' privacy policies are audited to determine if users are notified of the names of the companies which collect their data. Policies from 25 prominent third-party data collectors are also examined to provide deeper insights into the totality of the policy environment. Policies are additionally audited to determine if the choice expressed by the \"Do Not Track\" browser setting is respected. Third-party data collection is wide-spread, but fewer than 15% of attributed data flows are disclosed. The third-parties most likely to be disclosed are those with consumer services users may be aware of, those without consumer services are less likely to be mentioned. Policies are difficult to understand and the average time requirement to read both a given site»s policy and the associated third-party policies exceeds 84 minutes. Only 7% of first-party site policies mention the Do Not Track signal, and the majority of such mentions are to specify that the signal is ignored. Among third-party policies examined, none offer unqualified support for the Do Not Track signal. Findings indicate that current implementations of \"notice and choice\" fail to provide notice or respect choice.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Libert","given":"Timothy"}],"citation-key":"libertAutomatedApproachAuditing2018","collection-title":"WWW '18","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2018 World Wide Web Conference","DOI":"10.1145/3178876.3186087","event-place":"Republic and Canton of Geneva, CHE","ISBN":"978-1-4503-5639-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,23]]},"page":"207–216","publisher":"International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee","publisher-place":"Republic and Canton of Geneva, CHE","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"An Automated Approach to Auditing Disclosure of Third-Party Data Collection in Website Privacy Policies","type":"paper-conference"},

Many of such banners are implemented by Consent Management Providers (CMPs), who respect IAB Europe's Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF). Via cookie banners, CMPs collect and disseminate user consent to third parties. In this work, we systematically study IAB Europe's TCF and analyze consent stored behind the user interface of TCF cookie banners. We analyze the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive to identify potential legal violations in implementations of cookie banners based on the storage of consent and detect such suspected violations by crawling 1 426 websites that contains TCF banners, found among 28 257 crawled European websites. With two automatic and semi-automatic crawl campaigns, we detect suspected violations, and we find that: 141 websites register positive consent even if the user has not made their choice; 236 websites nudge the users towards accepting consent by pre-selecting options; and 27 websites store a positive consent even if the user has explicitly opted out. Performing extensive tests on 560 websites, we find at least one suspected violation in 54% of them. Finally, we provide a browser extension to facilitate manual detection of suspected violations for regular users and Data Protection Authorities.","author":[{"family":"Matte","given":"Célestin"},{"family":"Bielova","given":"Nataliia"},{"family":"Santos","given":"Cristiana"}],"citation-key":"matteCookieBannersRespect2020","container-title":"2020 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)","DOI":"10.1109/SP40000.2020.00076","event":"2020 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)","ISSN":"2375-1207","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5]]},"page":"791-809","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Do Cookie Banners Respect my Choice? : Measuring Legal Compliance of Banners from IAB Europe’s Transparency and Consent Framework","title-short":"Do Cookie Banners Respect my Choice?","type":"paper-conference"},

This work analyses how the most prevalent CMP designs affect people's consent choices. We scraped the designs of the five most popular CMPs on the top 10,000 websites in the UK (n=680). We found that dark patterns and implied consent are ubiquitous; only 11.8% meet our minimal requirements based on European law. Second, we conducted a field experiment with 40 participants to investigate how the eight most common designs affect consent choices. We found that notification style (banner or barrier) has no effect; removing the opt-out button from the first page increases consent by 22-23 percentage points; and providing more granular controls on the first page decreases consent by 8-20 percentage points. This study provides an empirical basis for the necessary regulatory action to enforce the GDPR, in particular the possibility of focusing on the centralised, third-party CMP services as an effective way to increase compliance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Nouwens","given":"Midas"},{"family":"Liccardi","given":"Ilaria"},{"family":"Veale","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Karger","given":"David"},{"family":"Kagal","given":"Lalana"}],"citation-key":"nouwensDarkPatternsGDPR2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6708-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,21]]},"page":"1–13","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Dark Patterns after the GDPR: Scraping Consent Pop-ups and Demonstrating their Influence","title-short":"Dark Patterns after the GDPR","type":"chapter","URL":"https://people.csail.mit.edu/ilaria/papers/Midas-MITCHI2020.pdf"},

  {"id":"papadogiannakisUserTrackingPostcookie2021b","abstract":"During the past few years, mostly as a result of the GDPR and the CCPA, websites have started to present users with cookie consent banners. These banners are web forms where the users can state their preference and declare which cookies they would like to accept, if such option exists. Although requesting consent before storing any identifiable information is a good start towards respecting the user privacy, yet previous research has shown that websites do not always respect user choices. Furthermore, considering the ever decreasing reliance of trackers on cookies and actions browser vendors take by blocking or restricting third-party cookies, we anticipate a world where stateless tracking emerges, either because trackers or websites do not use cookies, or because users simply refuse to accept any. In this paper, we explore whether websites use more persistent and sophisticated forms of tracking in order to track users who said they do not want cookies. Such forms of tracking include first-party ID leaking, ID synchronization, and browser fingerprinting. Our results suggest that websites do use such modern forms of tracking even before users had the opportunity to register their choice with respect to cookies. To add insult to injury, when users choose to raise their voice and reject all cookies, user tracking only intensifies. As a result, users’ choices play very little role with respect to tracking: we measured that more than 75% of tracking activities happened before users had the opportunity to make a selection in the cookie consent banner, or when users chose to reject all cookies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Papadogiannakis","given":"Emmanouil"},{"family":"Papadopoulos","given":"Panagiotis"},{"family":"Kourtellis","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Markatos","given":"Evangelos P."}],"citation-key":"papadogiannakisUserTrackingPostcookie2021b","collection-title":"WWW '21","container-title":"Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021","DOI":"10.1145/3442381.3450056","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-8312-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,19]]},"page":"2130–2141","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"User Tracking in the Post-cookie Era: How Websites Bypass GDPR Consent to Track Users","title-short":"User Tracking in the Post-cookie Era","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://publications.ics.forth.gr/_publications/3442381.3450056.pdf"},

  {"id":"sanchez-rolaCanOptOut2019","abstract":"The European Union's (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), in effect since May 2018, enforces strict limitations on handling users' personal data, hence impacting their activity tracking on the Web. In this study, we perform an evaluation of the tracking performed in 2,000 high-traffic websites, hosted both inside and outside of the EU. We evaluate both the information presented to users and the actual tracking implemented through cookies; we find that the GDPR has impacted website behavior in a truly global way, both directly and indirectly: USA-based websites behave similarly to EU-based ones, while third-party opt-out services reduce the amount of tracking even for websites which do not put any effort in respecting the new law. On the other hand, we find that tracking remains ubiquitous. In particular, we found cookies that can identify users when visiting more than 90% of the websites in our dataset - and we also encountered a large number of websites that present deceiving information, making it it very difficult, if at all possible, for users to avoid being tracked.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Sanchez-Rola","given":"Iskander"},{"family":"Dell'Amico","given":"Matteo"},{"family":"Kotzias","given":"Platon"},{"family":"Balzarotti","given":"Davide"},{"family":"Bilge","given":"Leyla"},{"family":"Vervier","given":"Pierre-Antoine"},{"family":"Santos","given":"Igor"}],"citation-key":"sanchez-rolaCanOptOut2019","collection-title":"Asia CCS '19","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2019 ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security","DOI":"10.1145/3321705.3329806","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6752-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,7,2]]},"page":"340–351","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Can I Opt Out Yet?

  {"id":"trevisanYearsEUCookie2019a","abstract":"AbstractPersonalized advertisement has changed the web. It lets websites monetize the content they offer. The downside is the continuous collection of personal information with significant threats to personal privacy. In 2002, the European Union (EU) introduced a first set of regulations on the use of online tracking technologies. It aimed, among other things, to make online tracking mechanisms explicit to increase privacy awareness among users.Amended in 2009, the EU Directive mandates websites to ask for informed consent before using any kind of profiling technology, e.g., cookies. Since 2013, the ePrivacy Directive became mandatory, and each EU Member State transposed it in national legislation. Since then, most of European websites embed a “Cookie Bar”, the most visible effect of the regulation.In this paper, we run a large-scale measurement campaign to check the current implementation status of the EU cookie directive. For this, we use CookieCheck, a simple tool to automatically verify legislation violations. Results depict a shady picture: 49 % of websites do not respect the Directive and install profiling cookies before any user’s consent is given.Beside presenting a detailed picture, this paper casts lights on the difficulty of legislator attempts to regulate the troubled marriage between ad-supported web services and","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Trevisan","given":"Martino"},{"family":"Traverso","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Bassi","given":"Eleonora"},{"family":"Mellia","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"trevisanYearsEUCookie2019a","container-title":"Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies","DOI":"10.2478/popets-2019-0023","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"126-145","source":"sciendo.com","title":"4 Years of EU Cookie Law: Results and Lessons Learned","title-short":"4 Years of EU Cookie Law","type":"article-journal","volume":"2019"},

  {"id":"utzInformedConsentStudying2019a","abstract":"Since the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018 more than 60 % of popular websites in Europe display cookie consent notices to their visitors. This has quickly led to users becoming fatigued with privacy notifications and contributed to the rise of both browser extensions that block these banners and demands for a solution that bundles consent across multiple websites or in the browser. In this work, we identify common properties of the graphical user interface of consent notices and conduct three experiments with more than 80,000 unique users on a German website to investigate the influence of notice position, type of choice, and content framing on consent. We find that users are more likely to interact with a notice shown in the lower (left) part of the screen. Given a binary choice, more users are willing to accept tracking compared to mechanisms that require them to allow cookie use for each category or company individually. We also show that the wide-spread practice of nudging has a large effect on the choices users make. Our experiments show that seemingly small implementation decisions can substantially impact whether and how people interact with consent notices. Our findings demonstrate the importance for regulation to not just require consent, but also provide clear requirements or guidance for how this consent has to be obtained in order to ensure that users can make free and informed choices.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Utz","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Degeling","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Fahl","given":"Sascha"},{"family":"Schaub","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Holz","given":"Thorsten"}],"citation-key":"utzInformedConsentStudying2019a","collection-title":"CCS '19","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2019 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","DOI":"10.1145/3319535.3354212","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6747-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,6]]},"page":"973–990","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"(Un)informed Consent: Studying GDPR Consent Notices in the Field","title-short":"(Un)informed Consent","type":"paper-conference"},
