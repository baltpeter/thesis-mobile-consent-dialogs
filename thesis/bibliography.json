  {"id":"acarWebNeverForgets2014","abstract":"We present the first large-scale studies of three advanced web tracking mechanisms - canvas fingerprinting, evercookies and use of \"cookie syncing\" in conjunction with evercookies. Canvas fingerprinting, a recently developed form of browser fingerprinting, has not previously been reported in the wild; our results show that over 5% of the top 100,000 websites employ it. We then present the first automated study of evercookies and respawning and the discovery of a new evercookie vector, IndexedDB. Turning to cookie syncing, we present novel techniques for detection and analysing ID flows and we quantify the amplification of privacy-intrusive tracking practices due to cookie syncing. Our evaluation of the defensive techniques used by privacy-aware users finds that there exist subtle pitfalls --- such as failing to clear state on multiple browsers at once - in which a single lapse in judgement can shatter privacy defenses. This suggests that even sophisticated users face great difficulties in evading tracking techniques.","author":[{"family":"Acar","given":"Gunes"},{"family":"Eubank","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Englehardt","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Juarez","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Narayanan","given":"Arvind"},{"family":"Diaz","given":"Claudia"}],"citation-key":"acarWebNeverForgets2014","collection-title":"CCS '14","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","DOI":"10.1145/2660267.2660347","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-2957-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,11,3]]},"note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220420154043/https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2660267.2660347","page":"674–689","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"The Web Never Forgets: Persistent Tracking Mechanisms in the Wild","title-short":"The Web Never Forgets","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://securehomes.esat.kuleuven.be/~gacar/persistent/the_web_never_forgets.pdf"},

  {"id":"bauerComparisonUsersPerceptions2013","abstract":"Identity providers such as Google and Facebook are increasingly used to sign in to third-party services like Flickr and USA Today. For users, this can increase convenience (e.g., fewer passwords to remember) and security (e.g., service providers need not keep passwords). At the same time, relying on identity providers that have rich information about users (e.g., all information in a Facebook profile) creates the risk that users will lose oversight or control over the access that service providers are given to this information. To address such concerns, identity providers show users consent interfaces at sign on and provide audit tools for post hoc review. In this paper we report on a 424-participant on-line study through which we seek to understand the effectiveness of these interfaces: We induced participants to log in with one of three identity providers, and measured their awareness of the information that was being sent by identity providers to service providers, their awareness of identity providers' audit tools, and their sentiment about various aspects of single sign-on. Participants logged in under one of two treatments: a basic treatment, which requested a minimum of personal data; and an invasive treatment, which requested data that most people would find invasive to their privacy. We found that participants' understanding of the information identity providers shared with service providers was based on preconception rather than the content of informational dialogs displayed by the identity providers; and that they were almost uniformly unaware of audit tools offered by identity providers. At the same time, many participants exhibited strong preferences and concerns about data sharing, several of which did not match current data-sharing practices.","author":[{"family":"Bauer","given":"Lujo"},{"family":"Bravo-Lillo","given":"Cristian"},{"family":"Fragkaki","given":"Elli"},{"family":"Melicher","given":"William"}],"citation-key":"bauerComparisonUsersPerceptions2013","collection-title":"DIM '13","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2013 ACM workshop on Digital identity management","DOI":"10.1145/2517881.2517886","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-2493-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,11,8]]},"note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220417102128/https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2517881.2517886","page":"25–36","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"A comparison of users' perceptions of and willingness to use Google, Facebook, and Google+ single-sign-on functionality","type":"paper-conference"},

Our data suggests that subtle positive effects of polite requests indeed exist, but stronger negative effects of heuristic processing dominate the aggregated results. Participants seem to be habituated to coercive interception dialogs---presumably due to ubiquitous EULAs---and blindly accept terms the more their presentation resembles a EULA.

  {"id":"boschTalesDarkSide2016","abstract":"Abstract Privacy strategies and privacy patterns are fundamental concepts of the privacy-by-design engineering approach. While they support a privacy-aware development process for IT systems, the concepts used by malicious, privacy-threatening parties are generally less understood and known. We argue that understanding the “dark side”, namely how personal data is abused, is of equal importance. In this paper, we introduce the concept of privacy dark strategies and privacy dark patterns and present a framework that collects, documents, and analyzes such malicious concepts. In addition, we investigate from a psychological perspective why privacy dark strategies are effective. The resulting framework allows for a better understanding of these dark concepts, fosters awareness, and supports the development of countermeasures. We aim to contribute to an easier detection and successive removal of such approaches from the Internet to the benefit of its users.","author":[{"family":"Bösch","given":"Christoph"},{"family":"Erb","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Kargl","given":"Frank"},{"family":"Kopp","given":"Henning"},{"family":"Pfattheicher","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"boschTalesDarkSide2016","container-title":"Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies","DOI":"10.1515/popets-2016-0038","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2016,10,1]]},"language":"en","note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220417152946/https://sciendo.com/article/10.1515/popets-2016-0038","page":"237-254","source":"sciendo.com","title":"Tales from the Dark Side: Privacy Dark Strategies and Privacy Dark Patterns","title-short":"Tales from the Dark Side","type":"article-journal","volume":"2016"},

  {"id":"degelingWeValueYour2019","abstract":"The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect on May 25, 2018. Its privacy regulations apply to any service and company collecting or processing personal data in Europe. Many companies had to adjust their data handling processes, consent forms, and privacy policies to comply with the GDPR’s transparency requirements. We monitored this rare event by analyzing changes on popular websites in all 28 member states of the European Union. For each country, we periodically examined its 500 most popular websites – 6,579 in total – for the presence of and updates to their privacy policy between December 2017 and October 2018. While many websites already had privacy policies, we ﬁnd that in some countries up to 15.7 % of websites added new privacy policies by May 25, 2018, resulting in 84.5 % of websites having privacy policies. 72.6 % of websites with existing privacy policies updated them close to the date. After May this positive development slowed down noticeably. Most visibly, 62.1 % of websites in Europe now display cookie consent notices, 16 % more than in January 2018. These notices inform users about a site’s cookie use and user tracking practices. We categorized all observed cookie consent notices and evaluated 28 common implementations with respect to their technical realization of cookie consent. Our analysis shows that core web security mechanisms such as the same-origin policy pose problems for the implementation of consent according to GDPR rules, and opting out of third-party cookies requires the third party to cooperate. Overall, we conclude that the web became more transparent at the time GDPR came into force, but there is still a lack of both functional and usable mechanisms for users to consent to or deny processing of their personal data on the Internet.","author":[{"family":"Degeling","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Utz","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Lentzsch","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Hosseini","given":"Henry"},{"family":"Schaub","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Holz","given":"Thorsten"}],"citation-key":"degelingWeValueYour2019","container-title":"Proceedings 2019 Network and Distributed System Security Symposium","DOI":"10.14722/ndss.2019.23378","event":"Network and Distributed System Security Symposium","event-place":"San Diego, CA","ISBN":"978-1-891562-55-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Internet Society","publisher-place":"San Diego, CA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"We Value Your Privacy ...

  {"id":"dehlingExploringFarSide2015a","abstract":"Background: Mobile health (mHealth) apps aim at providing seamless access to tailored health information technology and have the potential to alleviate global health burdens. Yet, they bear risks to information security and privacy because users need to reveal private, sensitive medical information to redeem certain benefits. Due to the plethora and diversity of available mHealth apps, implications for information security and privacy are unclear and complex. Objective: The objective of this study was to establish an overview of mHealth apps offered on iOS and Android with a special focus on potential damage to users through information security and privacy infringements. Methods: We assessed apps available in English and offered in the categories “Medical” and “Health & Fitness” in the iOS and Android App Stores. Based on the information retrievable from the app stores, we established an overview of available mHealth apps, tagged apps to make offered information machine-readable, and clustered the discovered apps to identify and group similar apps. Subsequently, information security and privacy implications were assessed based on health specificity of information available to apps, potential damage through information leaks, potential damage through information manipulation, potential damage through information loss, and potential value of information to third parties. Results: We discovered 24,405 health-related apps (iOS; 21,953; Android; 2452). Absence or scarceness of ratings for 81.36% (17,860/21,953) of iOS and 76.14% (1867/2452) of Android apps indicates that less than a quarter of mHealth apps are in more or less widespread use. Clustering resulted in 245 distinct clusters, which were consolidated into 12 app archetypes grouping clusters with similar assessments of potential damage through information security and privacy infringements. There were 6426 apps that were excluded during clustering. The majority of apps (95.63%, 17,193/17,979; of apps) pose at least some potential damage through information security and privacy infringements. There were 11.67% (2098/17,979) of apps that scored the highest assessments of potential damages. Conclusions: Various kinds of mHealth apps collect and offer critical, sensitive, private medical information, calling for a special focus on information security and privacy of mHealth apps. In order to foster user acceptance and trust, appropriate security measures and processes need to be devised and employed so that users can benefit from seamlessly accessible, tailored mHealth apps without exposing themselves to the serious repercussions of information security and privacy infringements.","author":[{"family":"Dehling","given":"Tobias"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Fangjian"},{"family":"Schneider","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Sunyaev","given":"Ali"}],"citation-key":"dehlingExploringFarSide2015a","container-title":"JMIR mHealth and uHealth","DOI":"10.2196/mhealth.3672","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,19]]},"language":"EN","page":"e3672","publisher":"JMIR Publications Inc., Toronto, Canada; https://web.archive.org/web/20220418190731/https://mhealth.jmir.org/2015/1/e8","source":"mhealth.jmir.org","title":"Exploring the Far Side of Mobile Health: Information Security and Privacy of Mobile Health Apps on iOS and Android","title-short":"Exploring the Far Side of Mobile Health","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},

These smartphones have become powerful devices that are basically miniature versions of personal computers. However, the growing popularity and sophistication of smartphones have also increased concerns about the privacy of users who operate these devices. These concerns have been exacerbated by the fact that it has become increasingly easy for users to install and execute third-party applications.

We empirically study  this  question  by  detecting  and  analyzing  cookie  notices in  an  automated  way.  We  crawl  1,500  European,  American,and  Canadian  websites  from  each  of  18  countries.  We  detect cookie  notices  on  40%  of  websites  in  our  sample.  We  treat  the presence or absence of cookie notices, as well as visual differences,as  proxies  for  differences  in  privacy  rules.  Using  a  series  of regression models, we find that the website’s Top Level Domain explains  a  substantial  portion  of  the  variance  in  cookie  notice metrics, but the users vantage point does not. This suggests that websites follow one set of privacy rules for all their users. There is one exception to this finding: cookie notices differ when accessing.com domains from inside versus outside of the EU.

Improving users’ online privacy cannot rely on individuals’ consent alone. We have to look for complementary approaches as well.

The platform consisting of an iOS app to monitor network traffic and a website to evaluate the results. Monitoring takes place on-device; no external server is required. Users can record and share network activity, compare evaluation results, and create rankings on apps and app-groups. The results are used to detect new trackers, point out misconduct in privacy practices, or automate comparisons on app-attributes like price, region, and category. To demonstrate potential use cases, we compare 75 apps before and after the iOS 14 release and show that we can detect trends in app-specific behavior change over time, for example, by privacy changes in the OS. Our results indicate a slight decrease in tracking but also an increase in contacted domains. We identify seven new trackers which are not present in current tracking lists such as EasyList. The games category is particularly prone to tracking (53% of the traffic) and contacts on average 36.2 domains with 59.3 requests per minute.","author":[{"family":"Geier","given":"Oleg"},{"family":"Herrmann","given":"Dominik"}],"citation-key":"geierAppChkCrowdSourcingPlatform2021","collection-title":"IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology","container-title":"ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-78120-0_15","editor":[{"family":"Jøsang","given":"Audun"},{"family":"Futcher","given":"Lynn"},{"family":"Hagen","given":"Janne"}],"event-place":"Cham","ISBN":"978-3-030-78120-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"language":"en","page":"228-241","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"The AppChk Crowd-Sourcing Platform: Which Third Parties are iOS Apps Talking To?","title-short":"The AppChk Crowd-Sourcing Platform","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.06167.pdf"},

  {"id":"grasslDarkBrightPatterns2021","abstract":"Dark patterns are (evil) design nudges that steer people’s behaviour through persuasive interface design. Increasingly found in cookie consent requests, they possibly undermine principles of EU privacy law. In two preregistered online experiments we investigated the effects of three common design nudges (default, aesthetic manipulation, obstruction) on users’ consent decisions and their perception of control over their personal data in these situations. In the first experiment (N = 228) we explored the effects of design nudges towards the privacy-unfriendly option (dark patterns). The experiment revealed that most participants agreed to all consent requests regardless of dark design nudges. Unexpectedly, despite generally low levels of perceived control, obstructing the privacy-friendly option led to more rather than less perceived control. In the second experiment (N = 255) we reversed the direction of the design nudges towards the privacy-friendly option, which we title “bright patterns”. This time the obstruction and default nudges swayed people effectively towards the privacy-friendly option, while the result regarding perceived control stayed the same compared to Experiment 1. Overall, our findings suggest that many current implementations of cookie consent requests do not enable meaningful choices by internet users, and are thus not in line with the intention of the EU policymakers. We also explore how policymakers could address the problem.","author":[{"family":"Graßl","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Schraffenberger","given":"Hanna"},{"family":"Borgesius","given":"Frederik Zuiderveen"},{"family":"Buijzen","given":"Moniek"}],"citation-key":"grasslDarkBrightPatterns2021","container-title":"Journal of Digital Social Research","DOI":"10.33621/jdsr.v3i1.54","ISSN":"2003-1998","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,8]]},"language":"en","number":"1; https://web.archive.org/web/20220418130030/https://jdsr.se/ojs/index.php/jdsr/article/view/54","page":"1-38","source":"jdsr.se","title":"Dark and Bright Patterns in Cookie Consent Requests","type":"article-journal","volume":"3"},
  {"id":"grayDarkPatternsLegal2021","abstract":"User engagement with data privacy and security through consent banners has become a ubiquitous part of interacting with internet services. While previous work has addressed consent banners from either interaction design, legal, and ethics-focused perspectives, little research addresses the connections among multiple disciplinary approaches, including tensions and opportunities that transcend disciplinary boundaries. In this paper, we draw together perspectives and commentary from HCI, design, privacy and data protection, and legal research communities, using the language and strategies of “dark patterns” to perform an interaction criticism reading of three different types of consent banners. Our analysis builds upon designer, interface, user, and social context lenses to raise tensions and synergies that arise together in complex, contingent, and conflicting ways in the act of designing consent banners. We conclude with opportunities for transdisciplinary dialogue across legal, ethical, computer science, and interactive systems scholarship to translate matters of ethical concern into public policy.","author":[{"family":"Gray","given":"Colin M."},{"family":"Santos","given":"Cristiana"},{"family":"Bielova","given":"Nataliia"},{"family":"Toth","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Clifford","given":"Damian"}],"citation-key":"grayDarkPatternsLegal2021","collection-title":"CHI '21","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","DOI":"10.1145/3411764.3445779","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-8096-6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,6]]},"note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220418125517/https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445779","page":"1–18","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Dark Patterns and the Legal Requirements of Consent Banners: An Interaction Criticism Perspective","title-short":"Dark Patterns and the Legal Requirements of Consent Banners","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03117307/document"},

  {"id":"harkousPolisisAutomatedAnalysis2018","abstract":"Polisis, an automated framework for privacy Policies analysis, enables scalable, dynamic, and multi-dimensional queries on privacy policies, and demonstrates Polisis's modularity and utility with two robust applications that support structured and free-form querying. Privacy policies are the primary channel through which companies inform users about their data collection and sharing practices. In their current form, policies remain long and difficult to comprehend, thus merely serving the goal of legally protecting the companies. Short notices based on information extracted from privacy policies have been shown to be useful and more usable, but face a significant scalability hurdle, given the number of policies and their evolution over time. Companies, users, researchers, and regulators still lack usable and scalable tools to cope with the breadth and depth of privacy policies. To address these hurdles, we propose Polisis, an automated framework for privacy Policies analysis. It enables scalable, dynamic, and multi-dimensional queries on privacy policies. At the core of Polisis is a privacy-centric language model, built with 130K privacy policies, and a novel hierarchy of neural network classifiers that caters to the high-level aspects and the fine-grained details of privacy practices. We demonstrate Polisis's modularity and utility with two robust applications that support structured and free-form querying. The structured querying application is the automated assignment of privacy icons from the privacy policies. With Polisis, we can achieve an accuracy of 88.4% on this task, when evaluated against earlier annotations by a group of three legal experts. The second application is PriBot, the first free-form Question Answering about Privacy policies. We show that PriBot can produce a correct answer among its top-3 results for 82% of the test questions.","author":[{"family":"Harkous","given":"Hamza"},{"family":"Fawaz","given":"Kassem"},{"family":"Lebret","given":"R."},{"family":"Schaub","given":"F."},{"family":"Shin","given":"K."},{"family":"Aberer","given":"K."}],"citation-key":"harkousPolisisAutomatedAnalysis2018","container-title":"USENIX Security Symposium","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018]]},"source":"Semantic Scholar","title":"Polisis: Automated Analysis and Presentation of Privacy Policies Using Deep Learning","title-short":"Polisis","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity18/sec18-harkous.pdf"},

  {"id":"hilsPrivacyPreferenceSignals2021","abstract":"Abstract\nPrivacy preference signals are digital representations of how users want their personal data to be processed. Such signals must be adopted by both the sender (users) and intended recipients (data processors). Adoption represents a coordination problem that remains unsolved despite efforts dating back to the 1990s. Browsers implemented standards like the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) and Do Not Track (DNT), but vendors profiting from personal data faced few incentives to receive and respect the expressed wishes of data subjects. In the wake of recent privacy laws, a coalition of AdTech firms published the Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF), which defines an optin consent signal. This paper integrates post-GDPR developments into the wider history of privacy preference signals. Our main contribution is a high-frequency longitudinal study describing how TCF signal gained dominance as of February 2021. We explore which factors correlate with adoption at the website level. Both the number of third parties on a website and the presence of Google Ads are associated with higher adoption of TCF. Further, we show that vendors acted as early adopters of TCF 2.0 and provide two case-studies describing how Consent Management Providers shifted existing customers to TCF 2.0.

  {"id":"hosseiniUnifyingPrivacyPolicy2021","abstract":"Abstract\nPrivacy policies have become a focal point of privacy research. With their goal to reflect the privacy practices of a website, service, or app, they are often the starting point for researchers who analyze the accuracy of claimed data practices, user understanding of practices, or control mechanisms for users. Due to vast differences in structure, presentation, and content, it is often challenging to extract privacy policies from online resources like websites for analysis. In the past, researchers have relied on scrapers tailored to the specific analysis or task, which complicates comparing results across different studies.\nTo unify future research in this field, we developed a toolchain to process website privacy policies and prepare them for research purposes. The core part of this chain is a detector module for English and German, using natural language processing and machine learning to automatically determine whether given texts are privacy or cookie policies. We leverage multiple existing data sets to refine our approach, evaluate it on a recently published longitudinal corpus, and show that it contains a number of misclassified documents.

  {"id":"huCharacterisingThirdParty2019a","abstract":"The recently introduced General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires that when obtaining information online that could be used to identify individuals, their consents must be obtained. Among other things, this affects many common forms of cookies, and users in the EU have been presented with notices asking their approvals for data collection. This paper examines the prevalence of third party cookies before and after GDPR by using two datasets: accesses to top 500 websites according to Alexa.com, and weekly data of cookies placed in users' browsers by websites accessed by 16 UK and China users across one year. We find that on average the number of third parties dropped by more than 10% after GDPR, but when we examine real users' browsing histories over a year, we find that there is no material reduction in long-term numbers of third party cookies, suggesting that users are not making use of the choices offered by GDPR for increased privacy. Also, among websites which offer users a choice in whether and how they are tracked, accepting the default choices typically ends up storing more cookies on average than on websites which provide a notice of cookies stored but without giving users a choice of which cookies, or those that do not provide a cookie notice at all. We also find that top non-EU websites have fewer cookie notices, suggesting higher levels of tracking when visiting international sites. Our findings have deep implications both for understanding compliance with GDPR as well as understanding the evolution of tracking on the web.","author":[{"family":"Hu","given":"Xuehui"},{"family":"Sastry","given":"Nishanth"}],"citation-key":"huCharacterisingThirdParty2019a","collection-title":"WebSci '19","container-title":"Proceedings of the 10th ACM Conference on Web Science","DOI":"10.1145/3292522.3326039","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6202-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6,26]]},"note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220417173653/https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3292522.3326039","page":"137–141","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Characterising Third Party Cookie Usage in the EU after GDPR","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/110158213/Characterising_Third_Party_Cookie_HU_Accepted6April2019_GREEN_AAM.pdf"},

  {"id":"kollnigAreIPhonesReally2022","abstract":"Abstract\nWhile many studies have looked at privacy properties of the Android and Google Play app ecosystem, comparatively much less is known about iOS and the Apple App Store, the most widely used ecosystem in the US. At the same time, there is increasing competition around privacy between these smartphone operating system providers. In this paper, we present a study of 24k Android and iOS apps from 2020 along several dimensions relating to user privacy. We find that third-party tracking and the sharing of unique user identifiers was widespread in apps from both ecosystems, even in apps aimed at children. In the children’s category, iOS apps tended to use fewer advertising-related tracking than their Android counterparts, but could more often access children’s location. Across all studied apps, our study highlights widespread potential violations of US, EU and UK privacy law, including 1) the use of third-party tracking without user consent, 2) the lack of parental consent before sharing personally identifiable information (PII) with third-parties in children’s apps, 3) the non-data-minimising configuration of tracking libraries, 4) the sending of personal data to countries without an adequate level of data protection, and 5) the continued absence of transparency around tracking, partly due to","author":[{"family":"Kollnig","given":"Konrad"},{"family":"Shuba","given":"Anastasia"},{"family":"Binns","given":"Reuben"},{"family":"Kleek","given":"Max Van"},{"family":"Shadbolt","given":"Nigel"}],"citation-key":"kollnigAreIPhonesReally2022","container-title":"Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies","DOI":"10.2478/popets-2022-0033","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"6-24","source":"sciendo.com","title":"Are iPhones Really Better for Privacy?

  {"id":"lexUpSetVisualizationIntersecting2014","abstract":"Understanding relationships between sets is an important analysis task that has received widespread attention in the visualization community. The major challenge in this context is the combinatorial explosion of the number of set intersections if the number of sets exceeds a trivial threshold. In this paper we introduce UpSet, a novel visualization technique for the quantitative analysis of sets, their intersections, and aggregates of intersections. UpSet is focused on creating task-driven aggregates, communicating the size and properties of aggregates and intersections, and a duality between the visualization of the elements in a dataset and their set membership. UpSet visualizes set intersections in a matrix layout and introduces aggregates based on groupings and queries. The matrix layout enables the effective representation of associated data, such as the number of elements in the aggregates and intersections, as well as additional summary statistics derived from subset or element attributes. Sorting according to various measures enables a task-driven analysis of relevant intersections and aggregates. The elements represented in the sets and their associated attributes are visualized in a separate view. Queries based on containment in specific intersections, aggregates or driven by attribute filters are propagated between both views. We also introduce several advanced visual encodings and interaction methods to overcome the problems of varying scales and to address scalability. UpSet is web-based and open source. We demonstrate its general utility in multiple use cases from various domains.","author":[{"family":"Lex","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Gehlenborg","given":"Nils"},{"family":"Strobelt","given":"Hendrik"},{"family":"Vuillemot","given":"Romain"},{"family":"Pfister","given":"Hanspeter"}],"citation-key":"lexUpSetVisualizationIntersecting2014","container-title":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","DOI":"10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346248","ISSN":"1941-0506","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,12]]},"page":"1983-1992","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"UpSet: Visualization of Intersecting Sets","title-short":"UpSet","type":"article-journal","volume":"20"},
  {"id":"libertAutomatedApproachAuditing2018","abstract":"A dominant regulatory model for web privacy is \"notice and choice\". In this model, users are notified of data collection and provided with options to control it. To examine the efficacy of this approach, this study presents the first large-scale audit of disclosure of third-party data collection in website privacy policies. Data flows on one million websites are analyzed and over 200,000 websites' privacy policies are audited to determine if users are notified of the names of the companies which collect their data. Policies from 25 prominent third-party data collectors are also examined to provide deeper insights into the totality of the policy environment. Policies are additionally audited to determine if the choice expressed by the \"Do Not Track\" browser setting is respected. Third-party data collection is wide-spread, but fewer than 15% of attributed data flows are disclosed. The third-parties most likely to be disclosed are those with consumer services users may be aware of, those without consumer services are less likely to be mentioned. Policies are difficult to understand and the average time requirement to read both a given site»s policy and the associated third-party policies exceeds 84 minutes. Only 7% of first-party site policies mention the Do Not Track signal, and the majority of such mentions are to specify that the signal is ignored. Among third-party policies examined, none offer unqualified support for the Do Not Track signal. Findings indicate that current implementations of \"notice and choice\" fail to provide notice or respect choice.","author":[{"family":"Libert","given":"Timothy"}],"citation-key":"libertAutomatedApproachAuditing2018","collection-title":"WWW '18","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2018 World Wide Web Conference","DOI":"10.1145/3178876.3186087","event-place":"Republic and Canton of Geneva, CHE","ISBN":"978-1-4503-5639-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,4,23]]},"page":"207–216","publisher":"International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee","publisher-place":"Republic and Canton of Geneva, CHE","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"An Automated Approach to Auditing Disclosure of Third-Party Data Collection in Website Privacy Policies","type":"paper-conference"},

As a key component in the mobile ad business model, mobile ad content has been overlooked by the research community, which poses a number of threats, e.g., propagating malware and undesirable contents. To understand the practice of these devious ad behaviors, we perform a large-scale study on the app contents harvested through automated app testing. In this work, we first provide a comprehensive categorization of devious ad contents, including five kinds of behaviors belonging to two categories: ad loading content and ad clicking content. Then, we propose MadDroid, a framework for automated detection of devious ad contents. MadDroid leverages an automated app testing framework with a sophisticated ad view exploration strategy for effectively collecting ad-related network traffic and subsequently extracting ad contents. We then integrate dedicated approaches into the framework to identify devious ad contents. We have applied MadDroid to 40,000 Android apps and found that roughly 6% of apps deliver devious ad contents, e.g., distributing malicious apps that cannot be downloaded via traditional app markets. Experiment results indicate that devious ad contents are prevalent, suggesting that our community should invest more effort into the detection and mitigation of devious ads towards building a trustworthy mobile advertising ecosystem.","author":[{"family":"Liu","given":"Tianming"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Haoyu"},{"family":"Li","given":"Li"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Xiapu"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Feng"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Yao"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Liu"},{"family":"Bissyandé","given":"Tegawendé"},{"family":"Klein","given":"Jacques"}],"citation-key":"liuMadDroidCharacterizingDetecting2020","container-title":"Proceedings of The Web Conference 2020","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-7023-3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,20]]},"note":"https://web.archive.org/web/20220417175910/https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3366423.3380242","page":"1715–1726","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"MadDroid: Characterizing and Detecting Devious Ad Contents for Android Apps","title-short":"MadDroid","type":"chapter","URL":"https://lilicoding.github.io/papers/liu2020maddroid.pdf"},

This enlarges the relevant design space for consent dialogs. Websites could try to maximize click-through rates and positive consent decision, even at the risk of users agreeing to more purposes than intended. We evaluate a practice observed on popular websites by conducting an experiment with one control and two treatment groups (N = 150 university students in two countries). We hypothesize that users’ consent decision is influenced by (1) the number of options, connecting to the theory of choice proliferation, and (2) the presence of a highlighted default button (“select all”), connecting to theories of social norms and deception in consumer research. The results show that participants who see a default button accept cookies for more purposes than the control group, while being less able to correctly recall their choice. After being reminded of their choice, they regret it more often and perceive the consent dialog as more deceptive than the control group. Whether users are presented one or three purposes has no significant effect on their decisions and perceptions.

Many of such banners are implemented by Consent Management Providers (CMPs), who respect IAB Europe's Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF).

In this work, we systematically study IAB Europe's TCF and analyze consent stored behind the user interface of TCF cookie banners. We analyze the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive to identify potential legal violations in implementations of cookie banners based on the storage of consent and detect such suspected violations by crawling 1 426 websites that contains TCF banners, found among 28 257 crawled European websites. With two automatic and semi-automatic crawl campaigns, we detect suspected violations, and we find that: 141 websites register positive consent even if the user has not made their choice; 236 websites nudge the users towards accepting consent by pre-selecting options; and 27 websites store a positive consent even if the user has explicitly opted out. Performing extensive tests on 560 websites, we find at least one suspected violation in 54% of them. Finally, we provide a browser extension to facilitate manual detection of suspected violations for regular users and Data Protection Authorities.","author":[{"family":"Matte","given":"Célestin"},{"family":"Bielova","given":"Nataliia"},{"family":"Santos","given":"Cristiana"}],"citation-key":"matteCookieBannersRespect2020","container-title":"2020 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)","DOI":"10.1109/SP40000.2020.00076","event":"2020 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)","ISSN":"2375-1207","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5]]},"page":"791-809","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Do Cookie Banners Respect my Choice? : Measuring Legal Compliance of Banners from IAB Europe’s Transparency and Consent Framework","title-short":"Do Cookie Banners Respect my Choice?","type":"paper-conference"},

We study the purposes defined in IAB Europe's Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) and their usage by advertisers. We analyze the purposes with regard to the legal requirements for defining them lawfully, and suggest that several of them might not be specific or explicit enough to be compliant. Arguably, a large portion thereof requires consent, even though the TCF allows advertisers to declare them under the legitimate interests basis. Finally, we measure the declaration of purposes by all advertisers registered in the TCF versions 1.1. and 2.0 and show that hundreds of them do not operate under a legal basis that could be considered compliant under the GDPR.","author":[{"family":"Matte","given":"Célestin"},{"family":"Santos","given":"Cristiana"},{"family":"Bielova","given":"Nataliia"}],"citation-key":"mattePurposesIABEurope2020","event":"APF 2020 - Annual Privacy Forum","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1","source":"hal.inria.fr","title":"Purposes in IAB Europe's TCF: which legal basis and how are they used by advertisers?","title-short":"Purposes in IAB Europe's TCF","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-02566891"},

  {"id":"mehrnezhadCrossPlatformEvaluationPrivacy2020","abstract":"As online services diversify, protecting user privacy becomes more complicated since user tracking as well as presented privacy options vary across platforms. We conduct a cross-platform evaluation on three different platforms: PC browser, mobile browser, and mobile apps, which is the first study of its kind. We study the tracking behaviours, privacy notice presentation, user control options, and further privacy enhancing technologies. Our study considers the top 116 EU websites and their corresponding Android apps (available for 101 out of 116 services). The results show that the privacy consent banner is presented to the user in various and inconsistent ways across websites, browsers, and mobile apps, where the majority of these consent notices do not comply with the GDPR. In addition, most of these services start tracking the user right after the website is loaded and the app starts running, without waiting for the user to interact with the privacy consent. This behaviour can be considered not respectful to the user and is, indeed, not compliant with current regulations.","author":[{"family":"Mehrnezhad","given":"Maryam"}],"citation-key":"mehrnezhadCrossPlatformEvaluationPrivacy2020","container-title":"2020 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy Workshops (EuroS PW)","DOI":"10.1109/EuroSPW51379.2020.00023","event":"2020 IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy Workshops (EuroS PW)","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9]]},"page":"97-106","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"A Cross-Platform Evaluation of Privacy Notices and Tracking Practices","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://eusec20.cs.uchicago.edu/eusec20-Mehrnezhad.pdf"},

This work analyses how the most prevalent CMP designs affect people's consent choices. We scraped the designs of the five most popular CMPs on the top 10,000 websites in the UK (n=680). We found that dark patterns and implied consent are ubiquitous; only 11.8% meet our minimal requirements based on European law. Second, we conducted a field experiment with 40 participants to investigate how the eight most common designs affect consent choices. We found that notification style (banner or barrier) has no effect; removing the opt-out button from the first page increases consent by 22-23 percentage points; and providing more granular controls on the first page decreases consent by 8-20 percentage points. This study provides an empirical basis for the necessary regulatory action to enforce the GDPR, in particular the possibility of focusing on the centralised, third-party CMP services as an effective way to increase compliance.","author":[{"family":"Nouwens","given":"Midas"},{"family":"Liccardi","given":"Ilaria"},{"family":"Veale","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Karger","given":"David"},{"family":"Kagal","given":"Lalana"}],"citation-key":"nouwensDarkPatternsGDPR2020","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","DOI":"10.1145/3313831.3376321","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6708-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,21]]},"page":"1–13","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Dark Patterns after the GDPR: Scraping Consent Pop-ups and Demonstrating their Influence","title-short":"Dark Patterns after the GDPR","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://people.csail.mit.edu/ilaria/papers/Midas-MITCHI2020.pdf"},

  {"id":"papadogiannakisUserTrackingPostcookie2021b","abstract":"During the past few years, mostly as a result of the GDPR and the CCPA, websites have started to present users with cookie consent banners. These banners are web forms where the users can state their preference and declare which cookies they would like to accept, if such option exists. Although requesting consent before storing any identifiable information is a good start towards respecting the user privacy, yet previous research has shown that websites do not always respect user choices. Furthermore, considering the ever decreasing reliance of trackers on cookies and actions browser vendors take by blocking or restricting third-party cookies, we anticipate a world where stateless tracking emerges, either because trackers or websites do not use cookies, or because users simply refuse to accept any. In this paper, we explore whether websites use more persistent and sophisticated forms of tracking in order to track users who said they do not want cookies. Such forms of tracking include first-party ID leaking, ID synchronization, and browser fingerprinting. Our results suggest that websites do use such modern forms of tracking even before users had the opportunity to register their choice with respect to cookies. To add insult to injury, when users choose to raise their voice and reject all cookies, user tracking only intensifies. As a result, users’ choices play very little role with respect to tracking: we measured that more than 75% of tracking activities happened before users had the opportunity to make a selection in the cookie consent banner, or when users chose to reject all cookies.","author":[{"family":"Papadogiannakis","given":"Emmanouil"},{"family":"Papadopoulos","given":"Panagiotis"},{"family":"Kourtellis","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Markatos","given":"Evangelos P."}],"citation-key":"papadogiannakisUserTrackingPostcookie2021b","collection-title":"WWW '21","container-title":"Proceedings of the Web Conference 2021","DOI":"10.1145/3442381.3450056","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-8312-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,19]]},"page":"2130–2141","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"User Tracking in the Post-cookie Era: How Websites Bypass GDPR Consent to Track Users","title-short":"User Tracking in the Post-cookie Era","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://publications.ics.forth.gr/_publications/3442381.3450056.pdf"},

Anonymizing datasets through de-identification and sampling before sharing them has been the main tool used to address those concerns. We here propose a generative copula-based method that can accurately estimate the likelihood of a specific person to be correctly re-identified, even in a heavily incomplete dataset. On 210 populations, our method obtains AUC scores for predicting individual uniqueness ranging from 0.84 to 0.97, with low false-discovery rate. Using our model, we find that 99.98% of Americans would be correctly re-identified in any dataset using 15 demographic attributes.

We evaluate both the information presented to users and the actual tracking implemented through cookies; we find that the GDPR has impacted website behavior in a truly global way, both directly and indirectly: USA-based websites behave similarly to EU-based ones, while third-party opt-out services reduce the amount of tracking even for websites which do not put any effort in respecting the new law. On the other hand, we find that tracking remains ubiquitous.

  {"id":"santosAreCookieBanners2020","abstract":"In this work, we analyze the legal requirements on how cookie banners are supposed to be implemented to be fully compliant with the ePrivacy Directive and the GDPR.\nOur contribution resides in the definition of 17 operational and fine-grained requirements on cookie banner design that are legally compliant, and moreover, we define whether and when the verification of compliance of each requirement is technically feasible.\nThe definition of requirements emerges from a joint interdisciplinary analysis composed of lawyers and computer scientists in the domain of web tracking technologies. As such, while some requirements are provided by explicitly codified legal sources, others result from the domain-expertise of computer scientists. In our work, we match each requirement against existing cookie banners design of websites. For each requirement, we exemplify with compliant and non-compliant cookie banners.\nAs an outcome of a technical assessment, we verify per requirement if technical (with computer science tools) or manual (with any human operator) verification is needed to assess compliance of consent and we also show which requirements are impossible to verify with certainty in the current architecture of the Web. &nbsp;For example, we explain how the GDPR’s requirement for revocable consent could be implemented in practice: when consent is revoked, the publisher should delete the consent cookie and communicate the withdrawal to all third parties who have previously received consent.\nWith this approach we aim to support&nbsp;practically-minded parties (compliance officers, regulators, privacy NGOs, researchers, and computer scientists) to assess compliance and detect violations in cookie banners’ design and implementation, specially under the current revision of the EU ePrivacy framework.","author":[{"family":"Santos","given":"Cristiana"},{"family":"Bielova","given":"Nataliia"},{"family":"Matte","given":"Célestin"}],"citation-key":"santosAreCookieBanners2020","container-title":"Technology and Regulation","DOI":"10.26116/techreg.2020.009","ISSN":"2666-139X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"91-135","source":"techreg.org","title":"Are cookie banners indeed compliant with the law? : Deciphering EU legal requirements on consent and technical means to verify compliance of cookie banners","title-short":"Are cookie banners indeed compliant with the law?","type":"article-journal","volume":"2020"},

  {"id":"trevisanYearsEUCookie2019a","abstract":"AbstractPersonalized advertisement has changed the web. It lets websites monetize the content they offer. The downside is the continuous collection of personal information with significant threats to personal privacy. In 2002, the European Union (EU) introduced a first set of regulations on the use of online tracking technologies. It aimed, among other things, to make online tracking mechanisms explicit to increase privacy awareness among users.Amended in 2009, the EU Directive mandates websites to ask for informed consent before using any kind of profiling technology, e.g., cookies. Since 2013, the ePrivacy Directive became mandatory, and each EU Member State transposed it in national legislation. Since then, most of European websites embed a “Cookie Bar”, the most visible effect of the regulation.In this paper, we run a large-scale measurement campaign to check the current implementation status of the EU cookie directive. For this, we use CookieCheck, a simple tool to automatically verify legislation violations. Results depict a shady picture: 49 % of websites do not respect the Directive and install profiling cookies before any user’s consent is given.Beside presenting a detailed picture, this paper casts lights on the difficulty of legislator attempts to regulate the troubled marriage between ad-supported web services and","author":[{"family":"Trevisan","given":"Martino"},{"family":"Traverso","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Bassi","given":"Eleonora"},{"family":"Mellia","given":"Marco"}],"citation-key":"trevisanYearsEUCookie2019a","container-title":"Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies","DOI":"10.2478/popets-2019-0023","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"126-145","source":"sciendo.com","title":"4 Years of EU Cookie Law: Results and Lessons Learned","title-short":"4 Years of EU Cookie Law","type":"article-journal","volume":"2019"},

  {"id":"utzInformedConsentStudying2019a","abstract":"Since the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2018 more than 60 % of popular websites in Europe display cookie consent notices to their visitors. This has quickly led to users becoming fatigued with privacy notifications and contributed to the rise of both browser extensions that block these banners and demands for a solution that bundles consent across multiple websites or in the browser. In this work, we identify common properties of the graphical user interface of consent notices and conduct three experiments with more than 80,000 unique users on a German website to investigate the influence of notice position, type of choice, and content framing on consent. We find that users are more likely to interact with a notice shown in the lower (left) part of the screen. Given a binary choice, more users are willing to accept tracking compared to mechanisms that require them to allow cookie use for each category or company individually. We also show that the wide-spread practice of nudging has a large effect on the choices users make. Our experiments show that seemingly small implementation decisions can substantially impact whether and how people interact with consent notices. Our findings demonstrate the importance for regulation to not just require consent, but also provide clear requirements or guidance for how this consent has to be obtained in order to ensure that users can make free and informed choices.","author":[{"family":"Utz","given":"Christine"},{"family":"Degeling","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Fahl","given":"Sascha"},{"family":"Schaub","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Holz","given":"Thorsten"}],"citation-key":"utzInformedConsentStudying2019a","collection-title":"CCS '19","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2019 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security","DOI":"10.1145/3319535.3354212","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-4503-6747-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,6]]},"page":"973–990","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"(Un)informed Consent: Studying GDPR Consent Notices in the Field","title-short":"(Un)informed Consent","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"zhangSensorIDSensorCalibration2019","abstract":"Sensors are an essential component of many computer systems today. Mobile devices are a good example, containing a vast array of sensors from accelerometers and GPS units, to cameras and microphones. Data from these sensors are accessible to application programmers who can use this data to build context-aware applications. Good sensor accuracy is often crucial, and therefore manufacturers often use per-device factory calibration to compensate for systematic errors introduced during manufacture. In this paper we explore a new type of fingerprinting attack on sensor data: calibration fingerprinting. A calibration fingerprinting attack infers the per-device factory calibration data from a device by careful analysis of the sensor output alone. Such an attack does not require direct access to any calibration parameters since these are often embedded inside the firmware of the device and are not directly accessible by application developers. We demonstrate the potential of this new class of attack by performing calibration fingerprinting attacks on the inertial measurement unit sensors found in iOS and Android devices. These sensors are good candidates because access to these sensors does not require any special permissions, and the data can be accessed via both a native app installed on a device and also by JavaScript when visiting a website on an iOS and Android device. We find we are able to perform a very effective calibration fingerprinting attack: our approach requires fewer than 100 samples of sensor data and takes less than one second to collect and process into a device fingerprint that does not change over time or after factory reset. We demonstrate that our approach is very likely to produce globally unique fingerprints for iOS devices, with an estimated 67 bits of entropy in the fingerprint for iPhone 6S devices. In addition, we find that the accelerometer of Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 devices can also be fingerprinted by our approach.","author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jiexin"},{"family":"Beresford","given":"Alastair R."},{"family":"Sheret","given":"Ian"}],"citation-key":"zhangSensorIDSensorCalibration2019","container-title":"2019 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)","DOI":"10.1109/SP.2019.00072","event":"2019 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)","ISSN":"2375-1207","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,5]]},"page":"638-655","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"SensorID: Sensor Calibration Fingerprinting for Smartphones","title-short":"SensorID","type":"paper-conference"},

  {"id":"zimmeckMAPSScalingPrivacy2019","abstract":"AbstractThe app economy is largely reliant on data collection as its primary revenue model. To comply with legal requirements, app developers are often obligated to notify users of their privacy practices in privacy policies. However, prior research has suggested that many developers are not accurately disclosing their apps’ privacy practices. Evaluating discrepancies between apps’ code and privacy policies enables the identification of potential compliance issues. In this study, we introduce the Mobile App Privacy System (MAPS) for conducting an extensive privacy census of Android apps. We designed a pipeline for retrieving and analyzing large app populations based on code analysis and machine learning techniques. In its first application, we conduct a privacy evaluation for a set of 1,035,853 Android apps from the Google Play Store. We find broad evidence of potential non-compliance. Many apps do not have a privacy policy to begin with. Policies that do exist are often silent on the practices performed by apps. For example, 12.1% of apps have at least one location-related potential compliance issue. We hope that our extensive analysis will motivate app stores, government regulators, and app developers to more effectively review apps for potential compliance issues.","author":[{"family":"Zimmeck","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Story","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Smullen","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Ravichander","given":"Abhilasha"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Ziqi"},{"family":"Reidenberg","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Russell","given":"N.
