  {"id":"hilsPrivacyPreferenceSignals2021","abstract":"Abstract\nPrivacy preference signals are digital representations of how users want their personal data to be processed. Such signals must be adopted by both the sender (users) and intended recipients (data processors). Adoption represents a coordination problem that remains unsolved despite efforts dating back to the 1990s. Browsers implemented standards like the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) and Do Not Track (DNT), but vendors profiting from personal data faced few incentives to receive and respect the expressed wishes of data subjects. In the wake of recent privacy laws, a coalition of AdTech firms published the Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF), which defines an optin consent signal. This paper integrates post-GDPR developments into the wider history of privacy preference signals. Our main contribution is a high-frequency longitudinal study describing how TCF signal gained dominance as of February 2021. We explore which factors correlate with adoption at the website level. Both the number of third parties on a website and the presence of Google Ads are associated with higher adoption of TCF. Further, we show that vendors acted as early adopters of TCF 2.0 and provide two case-studies describing how Consent Management Providers shifted existing customers to TCF 2.0. We sketch ways forward","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Hils","given":"Maximilian"},{"family":"Woods","given":"Daniel W."},{"family":"Böhme","given":"Rainer"}],"citation-key":"hilsPrivacyPreferenceSignals2021","container-title":"Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies","DOI":"10.2478/popets-2021-0069","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"249-269","source":"sciendo.com","title":"Privacy Preference Signals: Past, Present and Future","title-short":"Privacy Preference Signals","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://sciendo.com/en/article/10.2478/popets-2021-0069","volume":"2021"},

  {"id":"kollnigAreIPhonesReally2022","abstract":"Abstract\nWhile many studies have looked at privacy properties of the Android and Google Play app ecosystem, comparatively much less is known about iOS and the Apple App Store, the most widely used ecosystem in the US. At the same time, there is increasing competition around privacy between these smartphone operating system providers. In this paper, we present a study of 24k Android and iOS apps from 2020 along several dimensions relating to user privacy. We find that third-party tracking and the sharing of unique user identifiers was widespread in apps from both ecosystems, even in apps aimed at children. In the children’s category, iOS apps tended to use fewer advertising-related tracking than their Android counterparts, but could more often access children’s location. Across all studied apps, our study highlights widespread potential violations of US, EU and UK privacy law, including 1) the use of third-party tracking without user consent, 2) the lack of parental consent before sharing personally identifiable information (PII) with third-parties in children’s apps, 3) the non-data-minimising configuration of tracking libraries, 4) the sending of personal data to countries without an adequate level of data protection, and 5) the continued absence of transparency around tracking, partly due to","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Kollnig","given":"Konrad"},{"family":"Shuba","given":"Anastasia"},{"family":"Binns","given":"Reuben"},{"family":"Kleek","given":"Max Van"},{"family":"Shadbolt","given":"Nigel"}],"citation-key":"kollnigAreIPhonesReally2022","container-title":"Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies","DOI":"10.2478/popets-2022-0033","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"6-24","source":"sciendo.com","title":"Are iPhones Really Better for Privacy?

Many of such banners are implemented by Consent Management Providers (CMPs), who respect IAB Europe's Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF). Via cookie banners, CMPs collect and disseminate user consent to third parties. In this work, we systematically study IAB Europe's TCF and analyze consent stored behind the user interface of TCF cookie banners. We analyze the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive to identify potential legal violations in implementations of cookie banners based on the storage of consent and detect such suspected violations by crawling 1 426 websites that contains TCF banners, found among 28 257 crawled European websites. With two automatic and semi-automatic crawl campaigns, we detect suspected violations, and we find that: 141 websites register positive consent even if the user has not made their choice; 236 websites nudge the users towards accepting consent by pre-selecting options; and 27 websites store a positive consent even if the user has explicitly opted out. Performing extensive tests on 560 websites, we find at least one suspected violation in 54% of them. Finally, we provide a browser extension to facilitate manual detection of suspected violations for regular users and Data Protection Authorities.","author":[{"family":"Matte","given":"Célestin"},{"family":"Bielova","given":"Nataliia"},{"family":"Santos","given":"Cristiana"}],"citation-key":"matteCookieBannersRespect2020","container-title":"2020 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)","DOI":"10.1109/SP40000.2020.00076","event":"2020 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP)","ISSN":"2375-1207","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5]]},"page":"791-809","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Do Cookie Banners Respect my Choice? : Measuring Legal Compliance of Banners from IAB Europe’s Transparency and Consent Framework","title-short":"Do Cookie Banners Respect my Choice?","type":"paper-conference"},

We analyze the purposes with regard to the legal requirements for defining them lawfully, and suggest that several of them might not be specific or explicit enough to be compliant. Arguably, a large portion thereof requires consent, even though the TCF allows advertisers to declare them under the legitimate interests basis.
