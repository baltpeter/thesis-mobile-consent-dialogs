## Limitations

* No interaction with apps beyond consent dialog (e.g. first-run wizards not considered)
* Only considers text that is machine-readable and available to Appium (e.g. games are often essentially images that Appium can't "read")
* Only DE and EN supported
* Appium can only access a very limited amount of element attributes
* Analysis provides lower bound
